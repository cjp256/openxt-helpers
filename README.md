openxt-helpers
==============

my helper tools used for openxt development

prep-system/prep-wheezy.sh - used to setup a wheezy image - it is assumed that sudo is configured for the user.

build-forks/create-source-tree.sh - used to clone a full set of git repos locally to ~/openxt/sources/$treename

build-forks/create-build-tree.sh - used to stage a fresh build directory at ~/openxt/builds/$treename using the local source tree created above
